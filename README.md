# Solution for Calendar This Day 4
Collected code to satisfy the Day 4 progress for Multi Day project Calendar This
### Calendar This Day 4
This project will span most of the week and ask us to get to certain sections of an
overall outline. The code collected into this repository will take us through 
"Show the appointments on the page"
### Goal of this Repository
This multi-day project covers some material that we haven't had a chance to cover
yet as a class. While these concepts are coming and will get attention as the week
goes on, I thought it might be helpful to have a collection of milestones for the
project as it goes.
